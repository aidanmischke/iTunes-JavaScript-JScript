# iTunes-JavaScript-JScript
Manage iTunes on Windows using JavaScript with the iTunes SDK

Scripts that I use to manipulate tracks saving time while curating my iTunes library.

##Ensure machine is setup to run scripts 
###(only required once per machine)
Ensure script file Properties General tab has the Opens with set to 
"Microsoft Windows Based Script Host"
which has the following path "C:\Windows\System32\wscript.exe"

##Steps

1. Open the file in a text editor and ensure you understand the expected behavior of the script and any sections that require editing to suit your needs.

2. Remember there is no "undo" command for scripts.
So always test the script against a small set until you understand what it's actually doing.

3. Run script like any other program.
